Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, accounting for approximately 25% of all cancer cases. In 2015 alone, it affected over 2.1 million people. The disease begins when breast cells start to grow uncontrollably, often forming tumors. These tumors can typically be detected through mammograms (X-rays) or felt as lumps in the breast tissue. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and improved outcomes.
